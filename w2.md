I would suggest doing a spike to see if it’s possible to implement the solution.

In the spike we can explore the code base and see if it’s challenging to implement and note down our reasons on why it will not work with code-snippets and any online tech documentation(if applicable).

If the frontend application is hosted on the Web and we want to test out new FE features we could do A/B testing and have multiple versions of the A/B tests, and measure the users metrics and interactions for each test to select the winning A/B test.
Then we might have a good idea on how to implement the solution later.

I could also suggest doing flow-diagrams if we are to implement features that require users multiple actions that lead to different results. That way we can see problems before trying to code the solution.
