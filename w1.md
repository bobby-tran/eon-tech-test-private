I would first ask the product owner to create tickets for each type of features/bugs for the other apps.
So we can track these new issues and that the wider company/teams have visibility of these new tickets and not just myself and the product owner in secret.
This allows other team members to voice their opinions/concerns on these tickets as well.

In those tickets I expect detailed description of what is the problem, what they want, detailed acceptance criterias, and the severity.
Any other supported information like designs, error-logs, pictures, evidence, etc, etc, related to those tickets is another thing I would expect.

With the tickets created I would take a look at them and refine them and give them a rough estimate on how long the development and testing will take for each ticket. 

If the ticket estimate is higher than the time I have on my current project and the severity of the ticket is not critical for the current apps that are already operating normally, I have these options:
I would ask the product owner to place it in a backlog so I can look at it when I have time at another date.
I could ask the product owner if there is another team member who is available and if they also understand the details in the ticket, they could pick up the ticket.

If the ticket created is a critical bug and it’s affecting the operation of the other apps, I would first ask my manager above my level if it’s something I should look into ASAP. 
If I do get permission to fix the issue and the time to resolve it is quick, then I will fix the bug.
However, if the time to fix the bug might take longer I would ask if I can hand over my work for the time being to another member on the project if they are capable of doing so.
